            <h5>Author: Husam Farraj</h5>
            <h5>Date: February 14, 2023</h5>
            <br><br>
            <p>Offensive MVP - Samuel Hugh Henderson for executing great blocks all game, running crispy routes, making phenomenal
            catches and stepping up as a leader for us on the day. Sammy was exceptional all game, really setting the tone for us on
            offense from start to finish. It was a storybook ending for slant boy's last game with the Vikings, and he leaves the
            team with big shoes to fill so I'm really looking forward to seeing who is going to step up and fill them next year.
            <br><br>
            Defensive MVP - Luca Guzzo had another marquee performance, playing sideline to sideline all game, making great tackles
            and leading the defense in the backfield ensuring that everyone was in position. The Italian stallion was an extension
            of the coaching staff on the day ensuring that the adjustments in place were executed to a tee, and like Sam he ends his
            time with the Vikings in spectacular fashion and also leaves massive Prada shoes to fill.
            <br><br>
            Special Teams MVP - Ali Salman for showing us again how dangerous he is with the ball in his hands. "Flash" as he
            introduced himself to me the first time we met, has truly lived to his moniker this season. The ultimate playmaker and a
            true 'weapon', he was spinning around the field like a Beyblade fighting for every yard he could get and not giving up
            until he got his TDs. Another spectacular performance from the man that puts special in special teams.
            <br><br>
            Team MVP - Matthew Walsh for once again doing everything he can to help the team compete and putting a dominant
            performance on both sides of the ball. Matty has always put the Vikings first, playing hurt throughout the season and
            with a banged up shoulder. He's been a true warrior for the squad, committed throughout and always gives it his all
            whether he is running for 50 yard plus TDs or making sacks and tackles for loss in the backfield. For his first and last
            season with the Vikings, he has definitely also left an everlasting legacy like all our seniors this year and will be
            leaving massive shoes to fill.

            <br><br>
            <p>
            Offensive MVPs - The whole o line unit, Ethan Martin James Davies Max Sharpe Enzo Garny Robert Moss-Rathbone Cynan Anwyl
            Liam Bradley for putting in an incredible shift on the day. They put the extra time off the field and their hard work
            paid off massively for us on Sunday. Executing our new counter run scheme to perfection, creating running lanes up the
            middle and giving the QBs plenty of time to pass. Shout-out to Ronan McFadden and Jack Barron on the incredible runs
            they made and the receivers for their selfless blocking all game.
            <br><br>
            Defensive co-MVPs - Mike Koutsos for a phenomenal performance in his first game as a linebacker. Mikah displayed great
            aggression from the first whistle to the last, and continuously made great plays between the tackles and from sideline
            to sideline. Cynan Anwyl for showing us that not only is he a keyboard warrior (jk he's the best social media officer in
            the entirety of britball) but that he is an absolute menace in the backfield. Big sacks, tackles for loss and always
            making an attempt at stripping the ball out. Shout-out to the whole D for another lights out performance.
            <br><br>
            Special Teams MVP - Ali Salman the man that puts special in special teams. Ali stepped up massively for the team as a
            punter when called upon, not flinching but making great kicks to ensure we stay in contention for the field position
            battle. He also once again showed how deadly he is as a returner making massive gains everytime he touched the ball.
            Shout-out to the whole D for two incredible stops, the first to block their PAT and the second to influence their FG
            enough to ensure the game ended as a tie.
            <br><br>
            Team MVP - Robert Moss-Rathbone his height practically guarantees he would get head shotted in an actual battlefield
            trench, nonetheless Rob showed us that he is the master of the trenches. Lead from the front all game, both on O and D,
            even threatening to fight Coach Tom Garrity for taking him off for a couple of reps. Rob's performance is truly
            astonishing given how this is only his first year playing the sport and that is a testament to his great attitude and
            coachability. Shout-out to Matthew Walsh for making big tackles and sacks as a DE, Enzo Garny for stepping up as a
            lineman and making big blocks when the team needed him, and the whole receiver core again for their selfless blocking
            all game.

            <br><br>
            <p>Offensive Co-MVPs: Samuel Hugh Henderson Thomas Cliffe big performance from these two resulting in big TDs. Sam and Tom
            were dominant throughout offensively, continuously stretching the field and making big catches for first downs and
            points.
            <br><br>
            Defensive Co-MVPs: Oliver Michalak Spencer Dwyer Moss-Rathbone sacks, tackles for loss, fumbles and a crucial
            interception. What an incredible performance by Spence and Olly, showing the same stoutness and play making ability
            they've exhibited game after game.
            <br><br>
            Special Teams MVP: Ronan McFadden again for the great work he does in the kicking game, ensuring we came out victorious
            in the field position battle.
            <br><br>
            Team MVP: Matthew Walsh setting the tone for us on offense in the first half, for him to then do the same thing on
            defense in the second half. Matt led an exemplary effort for us offensively which showed us reach the potential we all
            know our team is capable of, and then went on the defense to make big tackles including a sack.
