        <h1>About Our Team</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The EHU Vikings are committed to excellence in sports and fostering a sense of camaraderie among our players. 
            Our mission is to strive for victory while promoting sportsmanship and teamwork. But most importantly, we accept the diversity of cultures a well as levels
            Many of our players have either played in previous teams or not played at all which allows for a strong level development of our players overall.
        </p>
        <div class="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our team was founded in 2014 with the goal of competing at the highest level. Since then, we have participated in numerous 
            tournaments and championships, showcasing our skills and dedication to the sport.
            <br><br>
            When the team was founded in 2014, we are a young team, that has already taken big steps on and off the field. In the early months of 2014,
            the team was training without kit or gear in a public park in Ormskirk, where Edge Hill is based. A year later, following a 
            successful application, the Vikings were granted Â£10,000 by Sport England, which paid for kit, jerseys, equipment, and our 
            way into the university league.
            <br><br>
            In April 2015, the Vikings took to the battlefield for the very first time. The team travelled north to Preston to play the 
            UCLan Rams in the annual varsity game, and the very first American Football game between the two. 2015 also sees our first ever 
            entry into the BUCS (British Universities Colleges Sport) league, in which we will play Bangor University, Keele University, 
            Liverpool University, and Liverpool JMU. This team has gone from no gear and training in a public park, to competitive league 
            in football in a year-and-a-half.
            <br><br>
            During the Covid-19 outbreak, the teams progress was stopped due to restrictions and we have been working hard to return at the level we
            once were. The 2021-2022 was marked as a rebuilding year to recruit as many players and rebuild the team entirely. This allowed us in the 
            2022-2023 season to get an entirely new coaching staff, play style to aim for promotion and a new committee. We went from 0/6 to 2/4/1 which
            marked an improvement in the team. This season also marked the first ever time Edge Hill University upsetted the UCLAN Rams settling for a draw during the season
            <br><br>
            Ever since the team has been working hard to move into DIV 1 Uniball and win a Championship and the 2023-2024 season has for objective to be 
            promoted to DIV 1 and restore its previous glory.
